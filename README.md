I have created two files for user 1 and 2 and use them to show the working of cpuser.c and it all worked well but the clearscreen part dosent work in vscode terminal so i have commented them out
run cpedituser.c in devc++ to get a clean conole ie one working with clearscreen.
I have include userdata.c so that you can create your own files to work with cpuser.c but it isnt perfect so make sure you dont make any typo while entering data
and if you use your own user.txt files make sure to update file name in cpuser.c
